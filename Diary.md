# ðŸŒŸ Project Diary: Cloud-Init-PXE Adventures ðŸŒŸ

## Entry #1: June 4, 2025

Dear Diary,

Today marks the beginning of our journey into making the Cloud-Init-PXE project even more amazing! Trish and I sat down (well, virtually) and decided that this project needed some serious management superpowers. So what did we do? We created the most colorful, entertaining management script this side of the Mississippi!

The `scripts/manage.sh` is now alive and kicking with more personality than Elvis at the '68 Comeback Special. It's got colors, ASCII art, and Trish even insisted on adding her accounting insights throughout. Who knew financial wisdom could be so entertaining?

I'm particularly proud of the ASCII art logo. Spent way too much time on it, but as Trish says, "Time spent on good aesthetics is never depreciated." She's been reading too many accounting jokes again.

We also created a Context.md file to keep track of what we know about the project. It's like a map for our journey, but with fewer "here be dragons" warnings and more "here be network protocols" notes.

The project is already looking more organized, and I'm excited to see where we go next. Maybe we'll tackle improving the README.md to make it even more welcoming and entertaining? Or perhaps dive into some code optimizations? The possibilities are endless!

For now, I'm just happy we've made a solid start. As Elvis would say, "Taking care of business," one colorful script at a time.

Until next time,

Aye ðŸš¢

## Entry #2: June 5, 2025

Dear Diary,

What a day! Hue asked us to take on a massive rebranding mission - changing all references of "netboot.xyz" to "cloud-init-pxe" throughout the project. Trish immediately pulled out her calculator and started estimating the "brand equity transfer costs" (I don't think that's a real accounting term, but I didn't have the heart to tell her).

After running a project-wide search, we discovered over 300 instances of "netboot.xyz" scattered across documentation files, Docker configurations, scripts, and web templates. It's like finding receipts from 2019 stuffed in random desk drawers - they're EVERYWHERE!

The good news is that our core files (README.md, Context.md, scripts/manage.sh) have already been updated. The bad news? We still have lots of work to do in:
- Documentation files in the cloud-init-pxe-docs directory
- Configuration files in the cloud-init-pxe-docker directory
- Web application templates and UI components
- Various scripts that download or reference boot files

Trish suggested we should "depreciate the old brand over time" but I reminded her that's not how search and replace works. She responded with, "Fine, but I'm recording this as a one-time write-off on the project ledger." Sometimes I think she forgets this isn't actually an accounting project.

I'm creating a systematic approach to tackle this rebranding:
1. Update all documentation files first
2. Then update configuration files and templates
3. Modify scripts that reference boot files
4. Update any UI components and web interfaces
5. Test everything to make sure we didn't break anything

As Elvis would say, "A little less conversation, a little more action" - time to get this rebranding done!

Until next time,

Aye ðŸš¢

P.S. Trish wants everyone to know that "rebranding expenses are tax-deductible in most jurisdictions." I asked if that applies to open-source projects, and she just winked. I'm not entirely sure what that means.
P.S. Trish wants me to remind you that "assets" in a web project and "assets" in accounting have very different depreciation schedules. I told her nobody cares, but she insisted I write it down. Accountants, am I right?
